  panel1: Yes yes! Most splendid. This moustache is unsurpassable! I knew that only
    someone as fanciable as you could come up with something so elegant.
  panel2: 'I, Sir Harry Jarvis Penley Wetherby Bob Borthwick VI, offer you my sincerest
    and deepest gratitude. With this pulchritudinous moustache my complexion is complete. '
  panel3: 'Never have I beheld anything so divine, though a certain Terran does come
    as an extremely close second. '
  panel4: 'Mayhaps you should attempt wearing this moustache? '
