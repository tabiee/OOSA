  panel1: I am always most gladsome when I have the opportunity of confabulating
    with you. Existence on this desolate vessel traversing the fabric of space and
    time can be very lonesome at times.
  panel2: Thus I am most delighted of meeting such a like minded individual. Despite
    your most toilsome schedule, you persevered making time for me.
  panel3: Let me take you along on my journey so we can continue this marvellous
    coexistence.
  panel4: I must frankly admit that I have taken a liking to you during our lengthy
    conversations. Most sincerely I hope that your susceptibilities towards me are
    of the same nature.
  panel5: Now then. If you would be most benignant and wait just a moment so I, Sir
    Harry Jarvis Penley Wetherby Bob Borthwick VI, can get everything ready for our
    most splendorous departure.
