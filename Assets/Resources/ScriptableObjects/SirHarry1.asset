  panel1: "Oh? If it isn\u2019t the captain themself honoring me with their most
    beauteous presence. How might you be in this most esteemed indeterminate time
    of existence?"
  panel2: I, Sir Harry Jarvis Penley Wetherby Bob Borthwick VI, am doing most splendidly.
    Even more splendidly now that I have the luxury of beholding such a captivating
    individual.
  panel3: Oh my, I certainly hope that you are not too overburdened by the arduous
    labor of the captainhood.
  panel4: Might I suggest that you take a wee respite?
  panel5: Maybe we could marvel at the sight of the nearby planet together for a
    timespan of several minutes. At no time does it fail to lighten up my mood.
