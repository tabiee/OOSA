  panel1: My dearest captain, you are from the verdant planet of Terra, are you not?
    I, Sir Harry Jarvis Penley Wetherby Bob Borthwick VI, do find Terra to be a highly
    likeable sphere to exist on.
  panel2: 'And highly likeable are the homines sapientes originating from there too.
    You, of course, being the beau ideal of all. '
  panel3: 'I have yet to journey to Terra myself but I have read a considerable amount
    of literature about your charming little planet. '
  panel4: 'When I ultimately plan a sojourn there, it would be most pleasant if you
    were to accompany me. But first I surely ought to look the part. '
  panel5: "I\u2019ve conceived that, regrettably, earthlings aren\u2019t always the
    most hospitable towards distinguished beings from outer space, such as myself.
    Hmm, what might aid me in blending in just perfectly?"
