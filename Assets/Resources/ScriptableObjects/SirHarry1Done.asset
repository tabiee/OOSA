  panel1: Marvellous! Now we can gaze into the tranquil scenery as much as we like.
    And it does provide the requisite amount of ambience to this deplorable little
    ship of space.
  panel2: 'Did you know that the most wonderful galaxy that I call home has two suns,
    just like this one? Oh how the sight still fills my mind with echoes from the
    foregone that feels ever so distant. '
  panel3: Though, supplementarily, it does fill me with some wistfulness. It has
    been a lengthy amount of time since I last feasted my eyes upon the magnificent
    vista of my home.
  panel4: The glamorous 18 moons lighting the indigo sky and the irradiant illumination
    of our most prodigious city, Eyzij. I have yet to behold a more splendid scenery.
  panel5: It would be my greatest pleasure to tour you around my wondrous place of
    origin in the glorious future. It can be a date if you so wish.
